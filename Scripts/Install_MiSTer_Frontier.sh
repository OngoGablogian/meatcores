# pulls in MiSTer Frontier files. Performs the only steps update_all
# can't do on its own:
#
#   1. chmod +x on the master daemon
#   2. Strip any obsolete per-core daemon registrations from earlier
#      MiSTer Frontier installs (pico8_daemon.sh, openbor_*_daemon.sh,
#      music_player_daemon.sh)
#   3. Register Master_Daemon in /media/fat/linux/user-startup.sh so it
#      auto-starts at every boot
#   4. Start Master_Daemon now so the user doesn't have to reboot
#
# Idempotent — re-running it is a no-op.
